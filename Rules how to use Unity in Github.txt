- WIP 3D models shall be in Dropbox! (>5 MB files can give some problems to sync it with Github)

- When you are going to work with the game then copy the whole unity folder somewhere on your computer!

- To avoid merge problems  no one shall work on the same script at the same time!

- The stage shall NEVER be changed! As it might give merge problems as well
